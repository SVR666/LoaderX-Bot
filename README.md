- Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- Search for Drive and enable it if it is disabled
- Finally, run the script to generate token file (token.pickle) for Google Drive:
```
pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Deploying on Heroku

- Run the script to generate token file(token.pickle) for Google Drive:

```
- Install [Heroku cli](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
- Login into your heroku account with command:
```
heroku login
```
- Create a new heroku app:
```
heroku create appname	
```
- Select This App in your Heroku-cli: 
```
heroku git:remote -a appname
```
- Change Dyno Stack to a Docker Container:
```
heroku stack:set container
```
- Add Heroku Postgres (only if you are deploying it for the 1st time)
```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql
```
- Add Private Credentials and Config Stuff:
```
git add -f credentials.json token.pickle config.env heroku.yml
```
- Commit new changes:
```
git commit -m "Added Creds."
```
- Push Code to Heroku:

# Using service accounts for uploading to avoid user rate limit
For Service Account to work, you must set USE_SERVICE_ACCOUNTS="True" in config file or environment variables
Many thanks to [AutoRClone](https://github.com/xyou365/AutoRclone) for the scripts
**NOTE:** Using service accounts is only recommended while uploading to a team drive.
## Generating service accounts
Step 1. Generate service accounts [What is service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts)
---------------------------------
Let us create only the service accounts that we need. 
**Warning:** abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do **NOT** recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 sa allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by google. 

```
Note: 1 service account can copy around 750gb a day, 1 project can make 100 service accounts so that's 75tb a day, for most users this should easily suffice. 
```

`python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only`

A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the service accounts

NOTE: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys project_id
```

### Add all the service accounts to the Team Drive
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```

# Youtube-dl authentication using .netrc file
For using your premium accounts in youtube-dl, edit the netrc file (in the root directory of this repository) according to following format:
```
machine host login username password my_youtube_password
```
where host is the name of extractor (eg. youtube, twitch). Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line
